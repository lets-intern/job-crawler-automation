# Repository Guide

A crawling automation backend. LLM generates the CSS selectors, a test run proves them, a workflow
runs them on a schedule, and the normalized result is served to a separate job board over REST.

Not a job board. `.claude/rules/core.md` states what follows from that.

Everything Claude Code needs lives under `.claude/`. The rules that constrain behaviour are imported
above; this file is the map that says where to look for the rest.

## The pipeline

```
URL 입력 → 셀렉터 생성(LLM) → 테스트 실행 → 워크플로우 등록 → 주기 실행
                                                                  ↓
                                        raw_jobs → 정규화 → normalized_jobs → 제공 API
```

Each stage fails independently and says which one failed. `.claude/docs/architecture.md` has the
detail.

| Registering a new site | `commands/new-site.md`, `skills/selector-generate/SKILL.md` |
| A selector stopped matching | `site-recipes/<domain>.md`, `skills/crawl-test/SKILL.md` |
| A workflow is failing | `commands/fix-workflow.md`, `skills/workflow-ops/SKILL.md` |
| Changing the fetch client, retry or scheduler | `rules/crawling.md`, `docs/architecture.md` |
| Writing or changing a Gemini API call | `rules/llm.md`, then the current Gemini API docs |
| Changing a table or writing a migration | `rules/data-safety.md`, `docs/data-model.md` |

All paths above are relative to `.claude/`.

## Two things that are easy to get wrong

A run that extracted nothing is a failure, not an empty success. If it reports as a clean run with
zero new postings, a site that changed its markup looks identical to a site with no new jobs.

Dirty extracted text is a normalization problem, not a selector problem. Fixing it in the selector
is how a working selector gets replaced with a fragile one.
